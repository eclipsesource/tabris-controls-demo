tabris-controls-demo
====================

Fork of the Eclipse RAP Controls demo (not maintained). The trypoint registered is called `controls`. So the demo will be available at:
http://SERVER:PORT/controls

> Please note: This is not an official demo. It's used to verify that the Tabris clients behave like the web client.
